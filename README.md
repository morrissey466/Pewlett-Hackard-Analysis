# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis - John Morrissey 

## Overview 
The Pewlett Hackard company is concerned about their aging employee demographic and are looking to do some analysis on what their future hiring needs will be. In this analysis we will be using SQL to pull data from different tables in order to better estimate future employee retirements. 

## Results 

 - The retirement title table we generated shows all employees born between 1952 and 1954, which would put them close to retirement age. In total, the list is 133,000 lines long. 
 - The retirement title table was then refined to only show the most current position at the firm. This eliminates duplicate data and gives a better representation on the actual employee count approaching retirement age. 
 - A list was then compiled to show the number of employees by title approaching retirement age. The list shows that the majority of those approaching retirement hold senior positions in the firm. 
 - A last list "membership eligability" was created which shows both dates of employment, title, and names and birthdates in order to better compile the data to one source. 

 ## Conclusion 

 In conclusion as the silver tsunami happens, the company will have to fill almost 30,000 senior engineer positions, almost 15,000 engineer positions, 29,000 senior staff, and 12,000 staff positions. Many of these positions are senior, meaning it may be harder to fill, or the company will have to pay more to recruit senior talent from other firms. There are more than enough retirement ready employees to mentor the next generation. The firm employees close to 300 thousand employees and those reaching retirement age makes up less than half of the workforce.
